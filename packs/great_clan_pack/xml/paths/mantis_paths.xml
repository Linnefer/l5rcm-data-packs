        <Description>
The Guardians of the Sun take an oath to repel all attacks
against their sacred charges. When defending a Moshi personage
or holding in a skirmish, you may choose to either
gain a bonus of +1k0 to your attack roll or to add an additional
+1k1 to the Armor TN of a person or object you are defending
with the Guard Action. You make this determination
at the start of your Turn during each Round of the skirmish.

Although they do not possess an ability to speak to the
kami, the Kitsune rangers are at home in the wilderness
like few others in the Empire. You gain a Free Raise on all
Hunting Skill Rolls and on any Stealth Skill Rolls made
while in a rural environment. Additionally, you gain a bonus
of +2k0 on any Contested Roll involving detection,
whether you are avoiding detection or attempting to detect
a hidden opponent.
